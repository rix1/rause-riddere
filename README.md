# Rause Riddere Votes

This is a site that let you read and vote on different items in the manifest of
"Rause Riddere", an ethos jokingly created by "Erlend & Steinar", a
[Norwegian podcast on NRK](https://radio.nrk.no/podkast/baade_erlend_og_steinar_/l_edf54d11-d100-4c12-b54d-11d100fc12f9).

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.

### Similar projects

- The main idea is inspired by https://www.rauseriddere.no/. I was missing the
  ability to vote on the different statements, which is why I made this.
